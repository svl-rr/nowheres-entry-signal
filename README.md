# SVL (Nowheres) Yard Entry Signal Driver

This is Arduino firmware for a microcontroller that has a pushbutton that
the yardmaster pushes to clear the signal. When the button is pressed,
the signal goes green for a constant amount of time and the buzzer plays
a chirping tone. After the time is up, the signal goes red again.
